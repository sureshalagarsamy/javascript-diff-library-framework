# What's the difference between a library and a framework?

### Library

A library is a reusable piece of code which you use as it comes. A library will usually focus on a single piece of functionality, which you access through an API. ```You call a library function, it executes some code and then control is returned to your code```.

For example ```jQuery``` ```D3.js``` ```Google Charts```

### Framework

A framework is a piece of code which dictates the architecture to your project. Once you choose a framework to work with, ```you have to follow the framework's code and design methodologies```. 

For example ```AngularJS``` ```ReactJS``` ```Ember.js```
